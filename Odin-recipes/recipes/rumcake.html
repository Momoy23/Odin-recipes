<p> <h4>What is Rum cake?</h4>
    <p>Popular in the Caribbean, rum cake is a vanilla cake that has rum in the batter. Traditionally, dried fruit is soaked in rum for months and then added to the cake batter, but we have a more accessible homemade version.</p>

    <p><h4>Does rum cake get you drunk?</h4>
    <p>Hah! Don't we all wish?! We put 1/2 cup of rum in the cake batter and another 1/3 cup in the glaze, so it likely will not get you drunk after the alcohol bakes off, but it might be best to not let the kids have a taste of this :)</p>
